4. Install simple Python application which would serve "Hello World!" via FCGI.
5. Make sure all your changes are persistent after reboot.

# Evaluation points

* Bash scripts best practices
* Python code best practices
* use of git, appropriate commit messages
* documentation: README and inline code comments
# Bonus points
* Use Ansible for server setup.
